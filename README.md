cloud4students aims to help students deploy their projects on Threefold Grid.

## Requirements

- docker-compose

## Build

- First create `config.json` check [configuration](#configuration)

- Change `VITE_API_ENDPOINT` in docker-compose.yml to server api url for example `http://localhost:3000/v1`

To build backend and frontend images

```bash
docker-compose build
```

## Run

First create `config.json` check [configuration](#configuration)

To run backend and frontend:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

- your backend will run at `http://localhost:3000/v1`
- your frontend will run at `http://localhost:8080`

If your machine has a public ip or a domain you can route your backend and frontend urls using caddy.

- example Caddyfile for a domain `example.com`

```Caddy
example.com {
  route /* {
    uri strip_prefix /*
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
  }
  route /v1/* {
    uri strip_prefix /*
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
  }
}
```

### Configuration

Before building or running docker compose, create `config.json` in the current directory.

example `config.json`:

```json
{
    "server": {
        "host": "localhost, required",
        "port": ":3000, required",
        "redisHost": "redis-db, make sure to change it in docker compose if you have other redis configurations, required",
        "redisPort": "6379, make sure to change it in docker compose if you have other redis configurations, required",
        "redisPass": "pass, make sure to change it in docker compose if you have other redis configurations, required" 
    },
    "mailSender": {
        "email": "your sendgrid account sender, required",
        "sendgrid_key": "<sendgrid-key>, required",
        "timeout": "<the timeout for app mail verification codes in seconds, required>"
    },
    "database": {
        "file": "<the path of the database file you have or you want to create, default is `database.sql`>"
    },
    "token": {
        "secret": "<your secret for the jwt tokens, required>",
        "timeout": "<the timeout of the jwt token in seconds, required>"
    },
    "account": {
        "mnemonics": "<your account mnemonic to be used for the deployments, required>",
        "network": "<grid-network, It can be main, qa, test, dev only, required>"
    },
    "version": "the version of your api like `v1`, required",
    "admins": ["<a set of the user emails you want to make admins>"],
    "notifyAdminsIntervalHours": "<the interval between admins notifications in hours, optional>",
    "adminSSHKey": "<an ssh key to be put with every deployment to prevent losing the vm if the user changed his ssh keys. optional>"
}
